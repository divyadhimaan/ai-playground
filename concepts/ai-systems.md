# AI Systems

## Generative AI (GenAI)

- AI models that **create content**— text, images, code, audio, video — based on learned patterns.

### Core Idea

- Predict the next best token/output.

### Capabilities

- Generate text (ChatGPT)
- Generate images (Midjourney, DALL·E)
- Write code, essays, designs
- Summarize, translate, rewrite

### Characteristics:

- **No memory** unless added externally
- **No autonomy** → acts only when prompted
- **Single-turn responders**

### Examples

GPT-4/5, Llama, Stable Diffusion, Claude, Gemini

---

## AI Agents

- Systems that **use generative AI models** (LLMs) PLUS*tools, memory, and reasoning loops** to perform tasks autonomously.

### Core Idea

LLM + Tools + Goals.

### Capabilities

- Plan → Execute → Reflect → Adjust
- Browse the web, call APIs, run code
- Multi-step task completion (RPA + AI)
- Task automation

### Characteristics:

- Limited autonomy
- Task-oriented but still **bounded**
- Depends on LLM as “brain”
- Works in loops (ReAct, CoT, RAG, planners)

### Examples

- GitHub Copilot Agents
- ReAct agents

## Agentic AI (next Evolution)
- A broader, more advanced class where AI systems show **goal-driven autonomous behavior**, similar to human agents.

### Core Idea

Autonomous systems that decide, act, learn, and self-improve.

### Capabilities

- Long-term memory
- Self-correction and self-evaluation
- Delegation to sub-agents
- Takes proactive actions
- Learns new skills/tools over time
- Can operate continuously

### Characteristics:

- **High autonomy** (not just task execution)
- Handles ambiguity, long-term goals
- Builds internal world models
- More robust planning & decision-making

### Examples

- OpenAI Agentic Framework
- Devin AI (autonomous IDE developer)
- Self-driving AI workflows


## Summary

| Concept           | Meaning                              | Autonomy | Key Verb       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Generative AI** | Produces content                     | None     | *Generate*     |
| **AI Agents**     | Executes tasks using AI + tools      | Medium   | *Do*           |
| **Agentic AI**    | Fully autonomous goal-driven systems | High     | *Act + Decide* |
