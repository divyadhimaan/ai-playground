# AI Playground

ai-playground is a collection of small experiments, notes, and projects exploring modern AI — including generative AI, agentic AI, AI agents, LLM prompts, automation workflows, and real-world use cases.
This repo acts as a personal learning space to test ideas, break down concepts, build mini AI tools, and document insights along the journey.
